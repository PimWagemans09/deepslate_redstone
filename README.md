# Deepslate Redstone
Deepslate Redstone is a datapack that allows you to craft redstone components with Cobbled Deepslate and Blackstone instead of Cobblestone, and Deepslate instead of Stone
You can of course still use cobblestone and stone in the crafting recipes but now you can mix in Cobbled Deepslate and Blackstone!

> [!NOTE]
> On 1.21.4 when you add the datapack during world creation the game may tell you that the datapack whas made for an older version of Minecraft even if you are using the 1.21.2 to 1.21.4 version of the datapack. But this datapack is compatible with the newer version so you can ignore this warning

Tested on all supported versions
